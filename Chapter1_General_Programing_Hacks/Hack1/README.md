# Hack 1: Make Code Disappear

*Problem:* Writing code takes time and introduces risk.

*The Hack:* Don't write code. After all the code that you don't write is the easiest to produce, debug, and maintain. A zero line program is the only one you can be sure has no bugs.

Writing code takes time so simply less code is easier to maintain and will likely contain less bugs. Reduce the amount of code used when possible.
